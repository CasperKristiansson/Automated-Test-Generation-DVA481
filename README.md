# DVA481 Automated Test Generation

The increasing competition pressure for rapid introduction of new or modified system versions is posing problems to properly testing software. These pressures have led many organizations to begin transitioning their development processes to agile development and continuous integration, greatly shortening the time available to conduct comprehensive testing.

This course provides an understanding of automating software testing using program analysis with the goal of intelligently and algorithmically creating tests. The course covers search-based test generation, combinatorial and random testing while highlighting the challenges associated with the use of automatic test generation.


## Course Content
- Understand algorithmic test generation techniques and their use in developer testing and continuous integration.
- Understand how to automatically generate test cases with assertions.
- Have a working knowledge and experience in static and dynamic generation of tests.
- Have an overview knowledge in search-based testing and the use of machine learning for test generation.
